# This is my notes of Git and GitHub

Starting with git and github, so git is a software where we add, commit, push and many more things we do whereas github is a hosting platform or a website which take code for local machine to remote so anyone can see what we coded. Git and Github are totally to each other.

Also Git is known as Version Control System(VCS).

To check git is installed, we use command

git --version

It will return with the version of git is installed thats indicates git is installed properly.

Now, we need to make account in github website to configure git in terminal. After this we configure git by using command in terminal are:

git config --global user.name "My Name"

Configuring is of two types such as "--global" and "--local". whenever we do any change with same github account will go on global configuration and if we do it with differnt github account then it goes with local configuration.

After these we will go with next steps as:

git config --global user.email "Your email"

To check, if git is config properly and check how many config is used.

git config --list
